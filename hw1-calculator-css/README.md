## Additional thoughts:
What HTML elements should you use, knowing that this front end will eventually be used for server-side calculation? Do the types of elements you use change when the front end is used for client-side (JavaScript) calculation?

I think that we should use the <form> element will be used in order to submit a request.

No my elements won't change when JavaScript is use as front side calcualtion.
